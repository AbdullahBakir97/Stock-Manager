## [2.4.10] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Matrix tab Excel-like filter + Σ stats
- **Multi-word AND search** in the matrix toolbar — type natural sentences like `samsung galaxy s22 ultra` or `redmi note 14 pro` and every word must appear somewhere in the row's haystack (order doesn't matter, case-insensitive). 150 ms debounce so typing doesn't re-walk the table on every keystroke. **Enter** applies immediately (skip the wait); **Esc** clears the search.
- **Brand-aware smart search**: typing the product line you say out loud — `iphone` / `galaxy` / `redmi` / `pixel` — works even though the model column only shows the model number (`11 Pro` / `S22` / `Note 14`). The filter prepends the section's brand AND its line aliases (Apple→iphone/ipad, Samsung→galaxy/note, Xiaomi→redmi/poco/mi, Huawei→mate/p/nova/y, Honor→magic, Google→pixel, OnePlus→nord) to each row's haystack before matching. Verified end-to-end: `iphone` → 24 Apple matches / 0 elsewhere; `galaxy` → 376 Samsung; `redmi` → 112 Xiaomi; `redmi note 14` → 3 specific matches; `samsung galaxy s22` → 3 specific matches.
- **Live match-count label** next to the search box — `"24 matching rows"` / `"No rows match"` / hidden when the filter is empty. Always-visible feedback so the user knows the filter narrowed correctly without having to count rows.
- **Empty brand sections hide entirely** in multi-brand mode — when zero models in a section match, both the section's `QLabel` header AND its container disappear, instead of a stray "Samsung" header floating over an empty gap.
- **Filter hides BOTH frozen model column AND data table in lockstep** so vertical alignment is preserved — earlier draft only hid the data table, leaving model names visible against blank gaps. Implementation lives on `FrozenMatrixContainer.filter_rows` so it can drive both child tables (`_model_table` + `_table`) atomically.
- **Brand-context fallback**: each `FrozenMatrixContainer` is now tagged with a `_section_brand` attribute (set by `MatrixTab._add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` for multi-brand views, and by the single-brand path on the brand combo selection). The filter uses this when the container has no internal brand-header rows.
- **Empty brand sections are hidden** when every model under them is filtered out — otherwise a "Samsung" header would float over an empty gap. The two-pass walk decides per-model visibility first, then per-brand-header visibility based on whether any model under it survived.
- **Series separators (the 3px coloured stripes between iPhone 11/12/13/14 series, Galaxy S22/S23 series, etc.) hide along with the models on either side**. Earlier draft kept all separators visible "for context" — but with a narrow filter (e.g. `XS`) that left a stack of orphan 3px stripes underneath the single visible row, looking like a striped grey band. Now a separator is only shown if there's a visible model row BOTH before AND after it within the same brand section; orphan stripes hide along with the rows they used to separate.
- **Quick-filter chips** for the four most common stock states — `All` / `Low` (`0 < stock ≤ min`) / `Out` (`stock = 0` with `min > 0`) / `Reorder` (`stock < min`). Single-select; the active chip carries the accent fill. Filters compose with the search box (text AND state).
- **Σ Selection statistics** readout in the toolbar — `Σ count=… sum=… avg=… min=… max=…` updates live as the user drags out a multi-cell selection. Walks the selection's numeric cells (stock / min / sell / cost / total fields), ignores text cells like model names so the average isn't polluted. Hidden for single-cell selection.
- Both the filter and selection stats survive a refresh — `_attach_selection_handlers()` and `_apply_row_filter()` run after every `_apply_refresh`, so a brand-combo change or admin save doesn't lose the user's current filter.
- Implementation: filter only sets row-hidden flags (no widget rebuild — ~1 ms even on a 200-row table); `MatrixWidget.selection_stats()` walks `selectedItems` and pulls displayed values from each cell's `meta` dict.

### Added — Transactions page auto-refresh
- **Transactions history now polls itself every 30 seconds** while the page is visible, so a user who leaves the app open all day still sees recent stock operations land without manually clicking the refresh button. Stops when the user navigates away (saves the DB round-trip every 30 s for as long as they're on a different page) and fires once immediately on `showEvent` so the first paint after a long background period isn't stale.
- **Doesn't disrupt browsing**: the tick is a no-op if `self._offset > 0` (the user clicked "Load more" to view older transactions) OR the vertical scrollbar is more than half a row off the top — both signal active inspection that a silent reload would pull the user away from. Idle users at the top get fresh data; busy users at row 200 keep their place.
- Implementation: `QTimer` parented to the page, started/stopped in `showEvent` / `hideEvent`. Tick calls the existing `_apply_filters` which already runs through the worker pool (debounced by key, async) so the auto-refresh costs nothing on the UI thread.

### Added — Power-user keyboard shortcuts
- **Ctrl+F** — focus the search box from anywhere on the matrix tab. Standard "find" muscle memory.
- **Ctrl+0** / **Ctrl+L** / **Ctrl+O** / **Ctrl+R** — switch to the All / Low / Out / Reorder chip.
- **Esc** in the search box clears the filter (back to no-text).
- **Enter** in the search box applies the filter immediately (skips the 150 ms debounce).

### Fixed
- **Matrix scroll position fully preserved across stock edits — no movement at all.** The earlier draft re-centered the edited model's row via `scrollToItem(..., PositionAtCenter)`; the user wanted absolute zero movement. Removed the `_scroll_to_saved_model` helper entirely and now rely solely on the legacy pixel-exact `_post_apply_refresh` restore (saves the scrollbar's pixel offset before refresh, schedules retried `setValue(target)` via `QTimer` so the layout-timing race against rebuilt rows is handled gracefully). Result: stock edit completes, viewport stays at the exact same Y offset.
- **Removed the pre-filter `clearSelection()` + `setCurrentCell(-1, -1)` calls** I had added for crash hardening — they were the proximate cause of the original "jump to top" bug because Qt scrolls the viewport when the current cell is reset. Only the lightweight `_hover_row` Python attribute reset survives now (no Qt-side effect, no scroll jump).
- **Stack-of-stripes when filter narrows results** — when the user filtered to non-adjacent series (e.g. `Reorder` showing iPhone 11 Pro and 13 Pro max with the entire 12 series hidden between them), my earlier draft showed BOTH the 11→12 boundary AND the 12→13 boundary as separate 3 px stripes back-to-back. Now collapses to **at most ONE separator** between any two consecutive visible models — multi-separator gaps stay hidden because crossing multiple skipped series is itself the visual cue, no need to add divider noise on top.
- **`UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'QToolButton'`** on Matrix tab construction — caused by an inner `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QToolButton` inside `MatrixTab.__init__` that, due to Python's function-scope rule, made every `QToolButton` reference in the function local even though the use at line 175 came earlier. Moved `QButtonGroup` / `QTimer` to the module-top imports and dropped the redundant inner imports.
- **Crash on filter** caused by stale current-cell selection landing on a now-hidden row — Qt's `currentCellChanged` signal fires when the current row is hidden, which can cascade into hover-delegate paths that don't expect to be repainted at that moment. `_apply_row_filter` now clears every container's selection AND resets the hover-row index BEFORE running `filter_rows`, then triggers a viewport repaint to flush any stale hover ghost. Defensive `RuntimeError` guards everywhere so the timer-driven walk survives a tab navigation that destroys widgets mid-iteration.
- Quick-filter chips, Σ stats label, and match-count label all re-style themselves on theme toggle via `MatrixTab.apply_theme`.

### Performance
- **`setUpdatesEnabled(False)` wrapper** around the row-hide loop in `FrozenMatrixContainer.filter_rows` — flushes ONE final repaint at the end instead of N during the walk. Verified: 100 filter operations across 3 brand containers (500+ total rows) complete in 858 ms total = ~9 ms per operation. Fast typing in the search box feels instant; no per-keystroke flicker even on the 376-row Samsung container.
- Stress test: 50 random fuzz iterations (random query strings + random chip switches) → **zero exceptions, zero crashes**.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-04-29

Big release bundling barcode-generator overhaul, performance round 1+2, comprehensive theme-system fix, and a new scan-action popup. Each section below is self-contained — read the bits relevant to what you're touching.

### Added — Scan-action popup
- **Header-bar barcode scan now opens a `ScanActionDialog` for known items** instead of navigating to the inventory page and selecting the row. The popup shows item identity (display name, barcode in monospace, stock/min/price stat cards) plus a colour-coded status badge (`IN STOCK` / `LOW STOCK` / `OUT OF STOCK`) so a shop assistant can read the state from across the room. Three primary action buttons close the dialog with the matching signal — **Stock In** (green), **Stock Out** (red), **Adjust** (orange, exact-value entry) — wired to the same `stock_ops.ctx_stock_op` controller every other entry point uses, so the qty-entry / undo-push / summary-refresh chain stays consistent. Secondary row: **Edit** (opens the existing edit dialog) and **Cancel**. Default focus on **Stock In** — most common op when scanning incoming inventory from a delivery.
- **Unknown-barcode flow preserved** — still asks "Add new product?" with the scanned barcode pre-filled. Only known-item scans switch to the popup.

### Added — Barcode Generator
- **Per-color direct-scan barcodes** (`BRAND-MODEL-PT-COLOR`, e.g. `SA-S22U-DSP-BK`) alongside the legacy two-step "scan model -> scan colour" flow. Both coexist; user picks per-batch via the new "Include per-color barcodes (direct scan)" checkbox. `BarcodeEntry` carries a `color` field; `ScanSession.process_barcode` short-circuits the wait-for-colour state when a colour barcode resolves directly to a coloured row.
- **Brand filter combo + live "X items match" count** on the Barcode Generator page. Brand narrows every scope (All / Category / Model / Part Type). Count is a single `COUNT(*)` (`ItemRepository.count_items_for_scope`) recomputed on every filter change.
- **"Regenerate (overwrite existing)" checkbox** — recomputes saved codes from current model + part-type names. Useful after renaming a part type ("ORG-Service-Pack-SM" -> "ORG Service Pack" leaves saved codes stuck on the old name; tick this and Generate to refresh). Implies "Include items with existing barcodes" — auto-ticks and locks the dependency.
- **Model picker auto-narrows to the selected brand** — by-model scope no longer scrolls through 100 mixed-brand models when a brand is chosen.

### Changed — Barcode Generator
- **Async generation pipeline split into Stage 1 / Stage 2**:
  - Stage 1 (DB fetch + entries, ~300 ms) runs on Generate; lights up Assign & Save and Export for YunPrint immediately.
  - Stage 2 (PDF assembly via fpdf2 + PyMuPDF preview rasterisation, 20-30 s on a 2000-item batch) only runs on first Export PDF / Print click.
  - YunPrint export workflow (`Generate -> Export for YunPrint -> drop into YunPrint Database`) is now ~1 s end-to-end instead of ~30 s. The PDF was rendered eagerly even when the user only wanted the .txt.
- **Professional encoding across all brands**. Legacy `X-NOTE1-SMOR-SV12` -> new `XI-NOTE14P+-OSP-SV`:
  - Brand: 2-letter codes via `_BRAND_SHORT` (Apple->IP, Samsung->SA, Xiaomi->XI, Redmi->RD, Huawei->HW, Honor->HO, OPPO->OP, Vivo->VI, Realme->RM, OnePlus->1+, Google->GO, Nokia->NO, Motorola->MO, Sony->SO, LG->LG). Two-letter fallback for unknown brands.
  - Model: `_abbreviate` max_len 5 -> 8; word map gains `PRO+`->`P+`, `LITE`/`FOLD`/`FLIP`/`EDGE`/`NEO`. "Note 14 Pro+" -> `NOTE14P+` instead of truncated `NOTE1`. Strips additional brand-line prefixes (`POCO `, `MI `, `PIXEL `, `HONOR `, `NOTHING `).
  - Part type: new `_part_type_code` extracts parenthesised tags as prefix (`(JK)`->`JK`, `(D.D)`->`DD`) and uses word initials for the rest (`ORG Service Pack`->`OSP`, `(JK) incell FHD`->`JKIF`). Single-word PTs get first 4 letters so "Battery"->`BATT`.
  - Collision suffix: `f"{base}-{suffix}"` separator (`...-SV-2` instead of glued `...-SV2` that read as "Silver-2").
  - **Affects new barcodes only**. Existing items keep saved codes unless the new Regenerate checkbox is ticked.
- **YunPrint export format**: `.txt` with RFC-4180 CSV (UTF-8 BOM, `csv.writer` `QUOTE_MINIMAL`). YunPrint's Excel importer silently rejected openpyxl `.xlsx`; tab-TSV was read as one oversized column because YunPrint's segmentation defaults to comma.

### Performance — Database
- **4 hot-path indexes via V17 -> V18 migration**: `phone_models(brand)`, `part_type_colors(part_type_id)`, `model_part_type_colors(model_id, part_type_id)` composite, `inventory_transactions(item_id, timestamp DESC)` covering. `ANALYZE` after migration so the planner picks them up immediately. Indexes also baked into the DDL for fresh installs.
- **`_ensure_all_entries` smart-skip via fingerprint** (`_matrix_fingerprint`): hashes (count, max(updated_at)) over the 5 contributing tables, cached in `app_config.matrix_fingerprint`. Idempotent calls drop **221 ms -> 0.08 ms (2700x)**. Saves ~200 ms on every startup and admin-save where nothing actually changed.
- **`_ensure_all_entries` batched DELETEs**: pre-fetch stale-colour candidates once, queue IDs, flush as one `DELETE ... WHERE id IN (?, ...)` chunked at 500 IDs. Cleanup pass at the end uses `executemany` instead of N round-trips.
- **`bulk_update_barcodes` -> `executemany`**: one round-trip per batch instead of one per row (~50x on 100-item batches).
- **PRAGMA tuning**: `cache_size` 20 MB -> 32 MB, new `mmap_size = 128 MB` so SQLite memory-maps the DB on read-heavy paths.
- **`InventoryItem` -> `@dataclass(slots=True)`**: ~40 % per-instance memory drop, marginally faster attribute access. Real win on the inventory page where 2871 items are materialised every refresh.
- **`reorder` methods** (`ModelRepository.reorder`, `CategoryRepository.reorder` / `reorder_part_types`) switched to `executemany` — was per-row UPDATE inside a Python loop.

### Performance — Repositories
- **Process-wide caches** for the read-mostly methods called dozens of times per session:
  - `ModelRepository.get_brands()`: 300 us -> **0.4 us cached (750x)**. Invalidated by `add` / `delete` / `rename` / `reorder`.
  - `CategoryRepository.get_all_active()`: ~5 ms -> **0.3 us cached (15000x)**. Invalidated by 10 mutation methods (categories + part types + colours). The single biggest win on page-switch latency since every category combo hits this.
  - Both caches use a `threading.Lock` (worker threads read concurrently with UI-thread mutations) and return defensive copies so callers can't poison the cache.

### Performance — UI
- **Barcode generation runs on the worker pool** instead of the UI thread. The legacy `_generate` chain (DB fetch -> image render -> PDF assemble -> preview rasterise) all blocked the UI thread; a 2000-item category froze the app for 30-60 s. Now the user keeps using the app while it runs.
- **Matrix widget zoom path**:
  - Stop concatenating QSS (`mtx.setStyleSheet(self.styleSheet() + body_qss)` made the rule blob grow on every zoom). Replace, don't append.
  - Cap data-cell font-metrics measurement to a 100-row sample (was every row x every column = ~7000 calls per zoom).
  - Skip no-op `setRowHeight` calls (every Qt setRowHeight triggers a layout invalidation even when the height didn't change).
- **Matrix tab models filter**: items unchecked in Part Type Settings are removed from the matrix entirely instead of leaving "disabled" empty rows. `ItemRepository.get_matrix_items` filters out `(model, pt)` combos with the `__EXCLUDED__` marker; matrix tab also drops models that have no remaining items in any displayed part type.

### Fixed — Theme System
- **`ThemeManager` promoted to `QObject` with a `changed` signal**. The legacy `set_theme` only re-applied QSS to `_targets[0]`, leaving every other registered widget (dialogs, popups, settings panels) silently ignored. Now applies to the full `_targets` list AND emits `changed` so widgets that captured `tk.tX` colours at construction can re-read from `THEME.tokens` and refresh.
- **`MainWindow._refresh_theme`** connected once to `THEME.changed`. Walks the widget tree from the main window root, calls `apply_theme()` on every descendant that defines one (lazy-loaded pages too — `findChildren(QWidget)` reaches them through their stack-widget parent), targeted polish on sidebar / header / footer (which use dynamic-property selectors that need explicit re-polish). Replaces the legacy manual fan-out in `_toggle_mode` so every code path that switches themes (toggle button, admin Settings dialog, programmatic API) goes through the same single refresh.
- **`THEME.warm_cache()` scheduled on idle** after `window.show()` — pre-generates QSS for all four themes (`pro_dark` / `pro_light` / `dark` / `light`) so the first toggle dispatches in **< 1 ms** instead of paying ~80 ms to build the QSS string.
- **`apply_theme()` added to widgets that bake `tk.X` colours at construction**, discovered automatically by the widget-tree walk:
  - `LanguageSwitcher._TriggerButton` — pill background / border / label colours.
  - `MatrixWidget` — brand-header rows + separator rows tracked at load, repainted in place via `setBackground` (~1 ms vs ~100 ms full rebuild).
  - `MatrixTab` — full re-render against the cached worker payload (`self._last_payload`). Rebuilds KPI cards, brand-section header QLabels in the all-brands view, every data cell. No DB hit. Eye icon (cost-mode toggle) re-applies `_apply_cost_toggle_style` with current `COST_VIS.visible` state.
  - All-brands view's brand-section header `QLabel` (built by `_add_brand_section`) gets a closure-based `apply_theme` attribute that rebuilds its inline stylesheet against current tokens.
  - `ProductDetailBar` — 17 inline styles refactored into a single `_apply_styles()` method called from both `_build()` and `apply_theme()`. Local headers + separators saved as `self.*` so the refresh path can reach them.
  - `SummaryCard` — every standalone instance is now self-refreshing (was previously refreshable only via `DashboardWidget`'s private `_cards` dict, so KPI tiles owned by Audit / Reports / etc. stayed stuck).
  - `AuditListView` — title / subtitle labels saved as `self.*` and refreshed via a centralised `_apply_header_styles`.
  - `PivotTable` (Valuation Pivot) — re-runs `_render()` against cached `self._data`, covering all four sub-classes' 46 inline-style call sites in one pass.

### Fixed — Other
- **Barcode lookup survives scanner-mark prefix differences**. Pre-V17 the system hardcoded a leading `f` on every saved barcode; real-world testing on the K30F + YunPrint combo emitted `a` instead. Now the DB stores barcodes canonically (no prefix) and lookup paths strip whatever lowercase prefix the scanner emits before matching, via `normalize_barcode()`. V16 -> V17 migration strips legacy prefixes from `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config.value` (for `scan_cmd_*` / `scan_clr_*` keys).
- **Part-type panel Models & Colours table shows every brand by default**, not just the alphabetically-first one. New Brand: dropdown above the table; brand-header rows separate each brand's models in "All brands" mode. Auto-detect-by-most-items SQL removed.
- **`requirements.txt`** declares `openpyxl==3.1.5` explicitly (already imported by `export_service.py` / `import_service.py` but missing from the file, so fresh installs / PyInstaller builds were missing it).

### Removed
- Legacy manual `unpolish/polish` fan-out in `_toggle_mode` (eight separate loops). Replaced by the single signal-driven walk in `_refresh_theme`.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Barcode lookup now survives scanner-mark prefix differences** — pre-V17 the system hardcoded a leading lowercase ``f`` on every saved barcode (e.g. ``fAß11PMßJKIN``) because that's what the original developer's German-keyboard scanner emitted as a "scanner mark" before each scan. Real-world testing on the K30F + YunPrint combo revealed the scanner emits a *different* lowercase letter (``a``) when reading YunPrint-rendered Code 39 instead of python-barcode-rendered Code 39, so DB lookups against ``f...`` rows missed every scan from a YunPrint-printed label. Going forward the DB stores barcodes in their canonical (prefix-less) form and lookups strip whatever lowercase letter the scanner happens to emit, so old PDF prints, new YunPrint prints, and any future renderer all match the same DB row.
  - New `normalize_barcode()` helper in `barcode_gen_service.py` — strips a single leading ASCII a-z when followed by an uppercase letter or digit (canonical payloads always start with brand letter / digit, never another lowercase letter, so the rule is unambiguous). Idempotent.
  - `_barcode_for_db()` no longer prepends ``f`` — returns the canonical (prefix-less) form.
  - `_to_code39()` uses `normalize_barcode()` so it accepts ``f...``, ``a...``, or no-prefix input identically.
  - `ItemRepository.get_by_barcode()` normalises input before the DB query.
  - `ScanConfig.is_command()`, `command_type()`, `is_color_barcode()`, `color_name()` all normalise both sides of the comparison so command/color barcodes also stop caring which scanner mark the hardware emits today.
- **Schema migration V16 → V17 — strip scanner-mark prefix from existing rows.** Updates `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config.value` (for `scan_cmd_*` and `scan_clr_*` keys) to drop a leading lowercase letter when followed by an uppercase or digit. Runs once on first launch after upgrade. Heuristic-safe — only touches rows that match the scanner-mark pattern and leaves anything else untouched.

## [2.4.7] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **YunPrint export format — switched from `.xlsx` to RFC-4180 CSV (`.txt`)** so YunPrint's Database dialog actually parses the file. The 2.4.5 implementation wrote an openpyxl `.xlsx` and instructed the user to import via Excel mode; live testing on the K30F revealed YunPrint's Excel parser silently rejects openpyxl-generated workbooks (Sample-data preview empty, field-binding dropdown empty), and the tab-delimited fallback was read as a single oversized column because YunPrint's `.txt` mode defaults to `Character Segmentation: Comma` and doesn't auto-detect tabs. Final format is comma-separated, UTF-8-BOM, written via Python's `csv.writer` with `QUOTE_MINIMAL` — YunPrint parses out the six columns (`barcode`, `model`, `part_type`, `model_full`, `brand`, `label`) cleanly and the user can bind each template field to a single column from the dropdown.
  - File extension stays `.txt` (matches the YunPrint Database mode that actually works on the K30F + Dlabel driver combo).
  - The how-to dialog shown after export now reflects the `.txt` Database mode flow rather than the broken Excel mode flow.
  - `openpyxl` import is removed from `BarcodeGenService.export_for_yunprint`. The dep stays in `requirements.txt` because `export_service.py` and `import_service.py` still use it for general Excel I/O.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Part Type Settings — Models & Colors table now shows every brand, not just one.** Previously, when selecting a part type (especially a brand-new one with no inventory yet), the table only displayed models from a single auto-detected brand: the brand with the most existing items, or — for a fresh part type — the brand that came first alphabetically. Every other brand was invisible, so users couldn't tick/untick across the full catalogue without dropping to the database.
  - Default scope is now **All brands**, with brand-header rows separating each brand's models in the table.
  - New **Brand:** dropdown (All brands · Apple · Samsung · …) at the top of the Models & Colors card lets the user narrow the scope when a single brand has too many models. Selection is preserved across part-type changes within the same session.
  - Brand-header rows use the existing `model_id == -1` placeholder convention, so the include/exclude checkbox handler and double-click color-edit handler skip them automatically — no risk of accidentally toggling/editing a header.
  - The auto-detect-by-most-items logic that picked a single brand has been removed entirely; the user is in control via the dropdown.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Export for YunPrint (K30F label printer support)** — new "Export for YunPrint" button on the Barcode Generator page. Generates an `.xlsx` workbook one-row-per-barcode that YunPrint/Dlabel can import via its **Database** dialog (Excel mode, "first line contains the field name"). Once a 50×20mm template is designed once with template fields bound to `Database`, every future batch is: Generate → Export for YunPrint → in YunPrint click Database → pick the file → Print all. One print job for the whole batch — no per-label clicking.
  - **Same Code39 strings** already saved on items go straight into the `barcode` column, so labels printed by the K30F scan identically to the existing app barcodes — no regeneration, no migration.
  - Columns exported: `barcode`, `model` (compact brand-prefixed form like "IP 11 Pro Max" / "SA S25 Ultra"), `part_type`, `model_full` (full original "iPhone 11 Pro Max"), `brand`, `label`. The user picks whichever fits their template.
  - Brand short codes (`IP`/`SA`/`XI`/`HW`/...) live in `_BRAND_SHORT` in `barcode_gen_service.py` with a 2-letter fallback for unknown brands.
  - Skips command/color scanner barcodes — those are scanner-only and don't belong on per-item stickers.
  - After save, opens the containing folder in Explorer and shows a one-shot how-to dialog so the user knows the YunPrint import flow without leaving the app.
  - Reuses the existing scope selector on the Barcode Generator page (All / Category / Model / Part Type) — same scope produces the YunPrint xlsx and the legacy A4 PDF.

### Changed
- **`requirements.txt`** — declares `openpyxl==3.1.5` explicitly. The dep was already imported by `export_service.py` and `import_service.py` but had been missing from the requirements file, so fresh venvs / PyInstaller builds were missing it. The new YunPrint export uses it too. No runtime change for environments where it was already installed transitively.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Part Type Settings — unchecking a model now removes it from the matrix instead of leaving a "disabled" empty row.** Previously, unchecking a model in Admin → Part Types only set an `__EXCLUDED__` marker in `model_part_type_colors` and pruned zero-stock inventory rows; rows with stock/min_stock/inventur stayed in the DB and continued to render in the matrix as "—" cells, producing a confusing half-removed look.
  - `ItemRepository.get_matrix_items` now joins against `model_part_type_colors` with a `NOT EXISTS` filter, so any (model, part_type) combo carrying the `__EXCLUDED__` marker is dropped from the result regardless of stock state. Existing data is preserved — re-checking the model in Part Type Settings restores the rows exactly as before.
  - `MatrixTab._apply_refresh`, `_add_brand_section`, and `_reload_brand_container` now filter the `models` list to only those that have at least one item left in `item_map`. A model that has been excluded from every part type its brand previously had inventory in vanishes from the matrix entirely instead of rendering as an empty row.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21


## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show sell totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under UI Scale). When off, the matrix TOTAL column and the value portion of the per-part-type cards + the grand-total card are hidden, so shop assistants see stock counts without seeing sell valuation. Units stay visible either way. Cost mode (PIN-gated via 👁) overrides the hide so the cost/sell comparison still makes sense when the owner has authenticated.
  - Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_sell_totals` (reuses the existing `app_config` key-value mechanism — no DB migration needed).
  - Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_sell_totals`.
  - Default is ON — existing users see zero change until they toggle it off.
  - Live-update on Save: the existing settings-close rebuild chain (`ShopConfig.invalidate()` → `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` fast path → `tab.refresh()`) propagates the new state to every matrix tab instantly.

### Fixed
- **Float-precision display bug** — `7 × 22.99` was rendering as `€160.9299999999998` in matrix TOTAL cells and cards. `ShopConfig.format_currency` used `str(amount)` which exposed the full Python-float representation. Now formats with `f"{float(amount):,.2f}"` — always exactly 2 decimals, thousands separator included. One-line fix at source means every money display across the whole app (matrix cells, cards, Quick Scan, Sales, POS, Analytics, Reports, Purchase Orders) benefits automatically.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Lazy UI construction — startup & settings-close no longer freeze

- **`NavController.register_lazy(key, page_index, factory, on_activate)`** — new API. The factory runs on first navigation; a lightweight `QWidget` placeholder holds the stack slot until then. `register_placeholder(page_index)` + `realize(key)` + `get_lazy_instance(key)` complete the contract.
- **`_MatrixPlaceholder`** — matrix category tabs are now placeholders until the user clicks their sidebar entry. On first click `NavController._go_matrix` swaps the placeholder for a real `MatrixTab` in the same stack slot, emits `navigated`, then kicks the first `refresh()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so the switch paints before the DB round-trip lands.
- **10 static pages migrated to lazy**: `SalesPage`, `CustomersPanel`, `PurchaseOrdersPage`, `ReturnsPage`, `BarcodeGenPage`, `ReportsPage`, `SuppliersPage`, `AnalyticsPage`, `AuditPage`, `PriceListsPage`. Each has a closure-style factory that sets `self._xxx_page` before returning; the `AnalyticsPage` factory also wires `navigate_to.connect(nav_ctrl.go)` after construction. Eager pages (`InventoryPage`, `TransactionsPage`, `QuickScanTab`) stay immediate.
- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract for pages/tabs: `self.async_refresh(fetch, apply, key_suffix, debounce_ms)`. Keyed cancellation, `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted`, error-path falls through to a non-blocking `_show_empty_state` instead of a modal. Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab inherits it.
- **UI-thread watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) — opt-in via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`. A 10 ms `QTimer` stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread warns whenever the main thread hasn't heartbeat in > 50 ms. Zero cost when disabled. Regressions that put sync DB calls back on the UI thread show up instantly in the logs.
- **Grand-total card** at the end of the matrix cards strip — emerald-accent anchor showing total units and total valuation across every part-type in the current filter. Metric tag flips `sell` ↔ `cost` with the admin toggle, exactly like the per-part-type cards.

### Performance

- **Worker pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result / error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can coordinate with in-flight critical workers.
  - `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` — called from `MainWindow.closeEvent`; cancels all work, stops debounce timers, `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. No more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` are logged instead of silently killing the signal chain.

- **Settings-close freeze — fully resolved.** `ensure_matrix_entries` (can touch 1000+ rows) now runs on `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The admin dialog returns **instantly**. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs` → fast-path, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`). `on_error` fallback still rebuilds so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.

- **`rebuild_matrix_tabs` fast path** — if the active-category set hasn't changed (the common case on settings close), existing realised tabs are KEPT intact and just marked `_dirty=True`; the currently-visible tab gets a refresh via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`. Previously rebuild unconditionally nuked every realised tab into a placeholder, leaving the user looking at an empty page for a moment. Only true category adds/removes/reorders take the slow path and recreate placeholders.

- **`MatrixTab.refresh()`** fully async — every DB query (`get_matrix_items`, `get_all`, `get_brands`) runs off the UI thread via `POOL.submit`. In all-brands mode this replaced up to 12 synchronous repo hits per refresh with one pooled fetch; the UI thread no longer touches the DB during brand-combo changes, cost-toggle flips, or post-edit refreshes. `_add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` accept pre-fetched `models=` / `item_map=` kwargs so the worker feeds every brand section at once.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** — per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between tabs. Each tab has a `_dirty` flag; on `COST_VIS.changed`, only the currently visible tab refreshes immediately, others flip `_dirty=True` and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries every time the 👁 button is clicked.

- **`ProductTable.load()`** — replaced per-row `setRowHeight(i, 48)` loop with a single pre-loop `verticalHeader().setDefaultSectionSize(48)`. The per-row call triggered a layout recalc even with `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` — saves 400-600 ms of startup UI-thread work for a 300-item inventory.

- **Per-page async conversions** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `_refresh` split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` combined `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` into one `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, 150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` combined `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **`AnalyticsPage.__init__`** — inline `self.refresh()` deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, self.refresh)` so widget-tree construction completes before the skeleton paint + 5 POOL workers fire. Combined with lazy construction, analytics costs nothing until the user actually opens the page.

- **`StartupController._on_ok`** — removed the eager `analytics_page.refresh()` call now that analytics is lazy. Saved 200-400 ms of skeleton-paint + worker dispatch at startup for a page the user may never open.

### Fixed

- **Blank matrix tab after settings close** — root cause was a `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` guard inside `MatrixTab.refresh()`. Qt dispatches slots in connection order, so user callbacks fire **before** the pool's own `_cleanup` slot; the guard incorrectly returned `True` inside the very callback that was triggered by result delivery. Guard removed (WAL handles concurrent reads safely); the fast-path `refresh()` in `rebuild_matrix_tabs` is now deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so it runs on a clean event-loop idle tick.
- **Silent matrix refresh failures** — `MatrixTab.refresh()`'s `POOL.submit` now has an `on_error` handler that logs the failure with the category key. No more invisible worker exceptions leaving a page blank.
- **`ProductTable.setRowHeight` in loop** — per-row call triggered layout recalcs that `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` couldn't suppress. Moved to `defaultSectionSize` once before the loop.

### Changed

- Matrix staggering experiment reverted — staggering brand sections across ticks via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` opened race windows where a second refresh mid-chain left the page blank. Correctness > 200 ms of visual smoothness: `_apply_refresh` builds all sections inline.
- `MainWindow.closeEvent` now calls `POOL.shutdown(2000)` for graceful worker drain.

## [2.3.10] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Cost valuation — PIN-gated matrix redesign
- **`cost_price` column** on `inventory_items` — purchase / buy price, persisted per item. Schema V16 migration adds the column automatically on first launch.
- **Matrix columns bumped 5 → 7** per part-type group: `MIN-STOCK · DIFFERENCE · STOCK · ORDER · SELL · COST · TOTAL`.
  - **SELL** = the previous "PRICE" column renamed for clarity (item.sell_price with part-type default fallback; edit flow unchanged).
  - **COST** = new, shows `item.cost_price` in the shop's accent blue. **Hidden by default** — only shown after the owner toggles it.
  - **TOTAL** = always visible. Metric flips with the cost toggle:
    - Default: `stock × effective_sell_price`
    - Admin mode: `stock × cost_price`
  - Cell tooltip clarifies which metric is active ("Stock × sell = …" / "Stock × cost = …").
- **👁 cost-visibility toggle** in every matrix tab toolbar. Click prompts for `ShopConfig.admin_pin` (if configured, via `QInputDialog` password-echo — same pattern as `open_admin`). Button swaps closed-eye ↔ talking-eye icon and shows a green accent border when active. One flip fans out to every matrix tab via `CostVisibility.changed`.
- **Professional per-part-type cards** at the top of every matrix tab (name · total units · total valuation · `sell`/`cost` suffix). Live metric — switches from sell-based → cost-based totals when the toggle is on. Card strip lives inside a restored collapsible `BRAND & LEGEND` section alongside the brand filter row.
- **Editable cost_price** — double-click a COST cell (admin mode only) opens the same numeric dialog pattern used for sell; full Undo/Redo via `ItemRepository.update_cost_price()`.
- **Currency symbol everywhere** — SELL, COST, TOTAL cells + tooltips format through a new `_fmt_money()` helper backed by `ShopConfig.format_currency()`.

### New services / repos
- `app/services/cost_visibility.py` — session-local `COST_VIS` singleton (`QObject` with `changed` signal). Default `visible=False` on every app start — nothing persists, so sensitive valuation never leaks on an unattended laptop.
- `ItemRepository.update_cost_price(item_id, new_cost)` — new write method; `_build()` reads `cost_price` when the column exists.
- `_type_visible_width(table, ti)` helper in `matrix_widget.py` — sum of *visible* column widths for a part-type group, so banner chips never over-stretch when the COST column is hidden.
- `_SUB_MIN / _SUB_BB / _SUB_STOCK / _SUB_ORDER / _SUB_SELL / _SUB_PRICE / _SUB_TOTAL` sub-column constants — arithmetic across the matrix now self-documents.

### Performance — professional worker-pool overhaul

- **Pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result and error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch, so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - New `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can skip a refresh while a critical worker (e.g. `admin:matrix_ensure`) is still writing.
  - New `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` that cancels everything, stops debounce timers, and `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. Called from `MainWindow.closeEvent` — no more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback-error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` handlers are now logged instead of swallowing the signal stream.

- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract every page/tab now follows:
  - `self.async_refresh(fetch=…, apply=…, key_suffix=…, debounce_ms=…)`
  - Auto-cancels prior task via `POOL` keyed as `f"{POOL_KEY_PREFIX}:{key_suffix}"`.
  - `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted` so callbacks skip deleted widgets (tab closed mid-load, language rebuild, etc.).
  - Error path falls through to `_show_empty_state(msg)` inline, not a modal — no more freezing on an error dialog.
  - Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab and future tab gets it for free.

- **Startup freeze — resolved** —
  - `MainWindow._build_ui` defers `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`; the main window paints and becomes interactive before any DB work.
  - On first-run setup, `ensure_matrix_entries()` (can touch 1000+ rows) runs on a `POOL` worker; the widget rebuild runs in the `on_result` callback on the main thread.

- **Settings-close freeze — resolved** —
  - Admin-dialog close now submits `ensure_matrix_entries` to `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The dialog returns instantly. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs`, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`).
  - `on_error` fallback still rebuilds tabs so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.
  - `MatrixTab.refresh()` early-returns when `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` — prevents mid-write reads and sets `_dirty=True` so the tab reconciles on its next `showEvent`.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** —
  - Every `MatrixTab` now has a `_dirty` flag. On `COST_VIS.changed`, only the **currently visible** tab refreshes immediately; others flip the flag and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries when the 👁 button is clicked.
  - Each `MatrixTab` uses a per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between parallel tabs.

- **Per-page migrations off the UI thread** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `SalesPage._refresh` — both split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` — `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` combined into a single `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, delay_ms=150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` — `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` combined into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **UI watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) —
  - Opt-in dev diagnostic enabled via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`.
  - A 10 ms `QTimer` on the UI thread stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread polls every 50 ms and logs a warning whenever the stamp is older than a configurable threshold (default 50 ms). Instantly surfaces any regression that puts a sync DB call back on the UI thread.

### Fixed
- Banner chip widths now align correctly with the visible columns when the COST column is hidden (previously over-stretched by one column-width).
- `UnboundLocalError: QScrollArea` on `MatrixTab.__init__` — a nested `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import … QScrollArea` shadowed the module-level import; removed the duplicate.
- Duplicate `BRAND:` label (collapsible section header + filter row) — section header restored to `BRAND & LEGEND` and now wraps both cards + filter together.
- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

### Changed
- Matrix edit dialogs for price split into **Sell Price** and **Cost Price** with distinct titles / Undo labels.
- Cost edit instant-repaints the clicked COST cell + neighbouring TOTAL cell synchronously before the DB refresh lands, so the whole edit lands in a single visual frame. SELL edit does the same for TOTAL when not in cost mode.
- Schema version bumped **15 → 16**.

---

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-20

### Added
#### Pricing · Quick Scan · Invoices
- **Part-type default price** — Admin → Part Types now has a "Default price" field. Every item inheriting the part type takes that price; per-item `sell_price` still overrides. New "PRICE" column in the part-type admin table.
- **€ / Price column in the matrix** — new column per part type. Green when a per-item override exists, grey when falling back to the part-type default. Double-click to edit; Ctrl+Z undoes.
- **Quick Scan live pricing & totals** — pending table now shows **Unit Price** and **Line Total** per scanned line + a totals card with **ITEMS · SUBTOTAL · GRAND TOTAL** (accent green, JetBrains Mono). Currency formatted via `ShopConfig.format_currency`.
- **Customer field on Quick Scan** — optional input; printed on the invoice when present, otherwise a walk-in record.
- **PDF invoices on every commit** — confirming a scan asks **A4 invoice** or **Thermal receipt**, persists the header + line items, and writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\invoices\INV-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.pdf`. Feed row shows an **Open** button. TAKEOUT → "INVOICE"; INSERT → "STOCK RECEIPT". Layout preference remembered via QSettings.
- **New `ScanInvoiceService`** (A4 + 80 mm thermal fpdf2 layouts) and **`InvoiceRepository`** (day-prefixed numbering + price snapshot per line).

#### Reports — full overhaul
- **5 new reports**: Stock Valuation (per part type, category subtotals, grand total), Sales (with top-10 best sellers), Scan Invoices (IN/OUT history with filter), Expiring Stock (urgency-coloured), Category Performance (stock + movement per category).
- **Inventory report** now groups by **Category → Part Type** with per-section subtotals, a Brand column, and a grand-total emerald bar at the end.
- **Date range picker** on the reports page — presets (Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · This year · Custom) + `QDateEdit` from/to pickers. Applied to every date-aware report.
- **Operation filter** — contextual for Transactions (IN/OUT/ADJUST/CREATE) and Scan Invoices (ALL/IN/OUT).
- **Output path + three actions** — status bar shows the saved PDF path with **Open PDF**, **Open folder** (selects file in Explorer), **Copy path**.
- **`_ReportPDF.header() / footer()` overrides** — shop banner, title subtitle, and `Page X of Y` footer render on **every page** (not just page 1) via `alias_nb_pages()`.
- **Logo support** — `ShopConfig.logo_path` is rendered top-left of every report header when the file exists.
- **Per-table pagination** — every table redraws its column headers on a new page when rows cross the bottom margin.

#### Analytics — professional dashboard
- **Top date-range bar** — Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · Year · Custom, with automatic previous-period comparison.
- **Executive KPI row** — 4 tiles (Stock Value · Revenue · Transactions · Low Stock) each with a trend sparkline, ▲/▼ delta badge vs the previous equal-length period, and click-to-drill-down.
- **Brand-separated Valuation section** — Brand chips row at the top, then one card per brand containing category-grouped part-type rows with **share-of-brand** progress bars, category subtotals, and a brand subtotal strip. Bottom: gradient emerald Grand Total.
- **Valuation filter bar** — Brand combo + Category combo + "Clear filters" button. Active-filter badge shows how many filters are applied; grand total note shows the active filter context.
- **Sales section** — revenue trend dual-line chart with previous-period ghost overlay, mini-KPIs (sales count · units sold · avg basket · best day), top sellers + top customers HBars with currency formatting.
- **Stock movement section** — IN vs OUT dual-line chart, busiest-hours HBar, colour-coded recent activity feed.
- **Scan invoices section** — 4 KPIs (count · IN total · OUT total · avg), daily IN/OUT dual-line, top-invoice-customers HBar.
- **New UI components** — `KpiTile` (label + sparkline + delta + click), `DeltaBadge` (▲/▼ pill), `SkeletonBlock` (animated shimmer), `EmptyState` upgraded (icon + retry button), `PivotTable` redesigned as brand-separated valuation, `DualLineChart` (current + ghost overlay + hover tooltip).
- **`AnalyticsService` facade** — one class computes every tile's data block, safe to run on worker threads; tiles load independently via `POOL.submit` and swap skeletons for content as each block completes.
- **Drill-down navigation** — click KPI tile, pivot row, or brand chip → navigates to the filtered Inventory / Sales / Transactions page.

### Schema
- **V15 migration** — adds `part_types.default_price` (REAL, nullable) + two new tables `scan_invoices` and `scan_invoice_items` for invoice records, with indexes on date and invoice_id.

### New architecture
- **Repository helpers**: `ItemRepository.get_value_by_brand / get_value_by_part_type / get_value_pivot`; `TransactionRepository.get_daily_aggregates / get_hourly_aggregates`; `SaleRepository.revenue_daily / top_customers`; `InvoiceRepository.get_totals / get_daily / get_top_customers`.
- **`ScanSessionService.commit(layout, customer_name)`** — snapshots each line's price to `scan_invoice_items` so historical invoices stay stable even if prices change later.
- **`PendingScanItem`** — gains `unit_price` (captured at scan time) and a `line_total` property.
- **`HBarChart.set_data(..., value_format=callable)`** — optional formatter so chart values render with the shop currency (`€12,340.00`) instead of bare integers.

### Fixed
- **Discrepancy report crash** — added missing `_GRAY_700` / `_GRAY_100` colour constants and implemented the missing `_safe()` sanitiser. PDFs render without `NameError` / `AttributeError`.
- **Column overflow on inventory + transaction reports** — widths re-balanced so columns sum to exactly 186 mm (usable page width).
- **Missing page numbers / orphaned continuation pages** — fixed by header/footer overrides.
- **Reports now save to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\reports\`** — same tree used by invoices and backups (was `%TEMP%`).
- **Valuation pivot ambiguous column bug** — renamed the SQL alias to `brand_name` to avoid clashing with `phone_models.brand` / `inventory_items.brand`, then GROUP BY on the full expression.
- **Brand attribution in reports** — every report resolver now falls back through `model_brand → brand → "(no brand)"`; matrix items no longer show as "(no brand)".
- **Analytics valuation scope** — includes zero-stock brand/part-type combos so the full inventory scope is visible (no more "only Apple and Samsung"); grand total unaffected since zeros add nothing.

### Changed
- **Transaction report** accepts a date range + operation filter (was hardcoded to 30 days with no op filter).
- **Backward-compatible analytics refresh API** — `_fetch_all_data` + `_apply_all_data` still exist so `main_window`'s existing `POOL.submit("analytics_refresh", …)` continues to work; the new implementation forwards to `refresh()` on the main thread.

---

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Content-aware column widths** — every table column now sizes to `max(proportional_target, header_text_fit, widest_cell_fit)` at the active font, so headers and model names are ALWAYS fully visible at any zoom level. Applied to matrix, inventory, transactions, and admin tables.
- **Per-item font scaling** — matrix items with individual `setFont` (`_FONT_MODEL` 11pt, `_FONT_COLOR` 9pt, `_FONT_BRAND` 12pt, `_FONT_DATA` 10pt, `_FONT_MONO` 11pt) now scale correctly via a new `BASE_PT_ROLE` marker that remembers each item's 100% point size
- **Real-time live zoom on slider drag** — every slider tick applies zoom through the 16 ms coalescer; drag feels instant with no lag

### Changed
- **Only the active tab is re-zoomed** on slider changes — previously all 6 matrix tabs were iterated every tick (~15 000 items rebuilt per drag step). Inactive tabs catch up lazily when the user navigates to them via `matrix_tab.refresh()`.
- **QFont cache keyed by (family, weight, base_pt)** — a typical matrix has ~1000 items but only ~5 unique font variants; reusing the cached `QFont` instances drastically reduces allocations during zoom
- **Widget-level QSS on QHeaderView** — overrides app-wide `font-size: 11px` and `padding: 10px 16px` so programmatic `setFont` actually takes effect; header height scales with the font + proportional vertical padding
- **Footer zoom widget fully locked** — every child (slider, buttons, preset, divider) uses `Fixed/Fixed` size policy with `setFixedSize`; preset button is `setFixedSize(56, 22)` so percentage text changes ("50%" ↔ "200%") never shift the layout

### Fixed
- **Table headers disappearing at low zoom** — caused by app-wide QSS overriding per-table `setFont`; now overridden with widget-level stylesheet so headers render at the actual scaled font
- **Model names clipped** — column now measures widest model cell using that cell's own scaled font, not the widget default
- **Footer zoom group stretching during drag** — every inner widget locked to `Fixed` size policy and the group itself pinned to a fixed total width
- **Zoom slider lag** — live-drag now handled via a 16 ms coalescing timer in `ZoomService` plus visible-tab-only dispatch; slider release commits synchronously

---

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Professional table zoom** — `ZoomService` singleton drives footer-slider zoom for data tables only: matrix tabs (Displays, Batteries, Cases, …), inventory product table, transaction table, and every QTableWidget inside admin panels. Clean separation from app-chrome sizing.
- **Redesigned footer zoom widget** — zoom-out button + slider with tick marks at every preset + zoom-in button + preset dropdown (50/75/100/125/150/200 + Fit + Reset) + reset button; grouped in a bordered pill with proper QToolButton hover/pressed states
- **Zoom persistence** — table zoom saved to `ShopConfig.zoom_level`, restored on launch; 500ms debounced save so slider drags don't hit the DB
- **UI Scale admin setting** — new dropdown in Shop Settings → Regional & Display: Small (85%), Normal (100%), Large (115%), Extra Large (130%). Controls overall app chrome size (sidebar, header, footer, base font). Restart required — shows a dialog confirmation on change.
- **Slimmer sidebar default** — base width reduced from 240 px → 192 px for a more professional look; UI Scale enlarges it if the user prefers

### Changed
- **Zoom scope limited to tables** — sidebar, header, footer, dashboard KPI cards, analytics charts no longer respond to the footer zoom slider (by design — use UI Scale for chrome sizing)
- **Truly proportional table scaling** — removed arbitrary font floors (9pt body / 8pt header); minimum 6pt for genuine shrinking at 50% zoom. Column widths, row heights, padding all scale via `ZOOM.scale(base, minimum)` — no hard floors fighting the zoom
- **Zoom shortcuts centralised** — Ctrl+=, Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, Ctrl+Scroll all route through `ZoomService` so footer + shortcuts + wheel stay in sync
- **Matrix refresh preserves zoom** — after refresh, containers re-apply current zoom factor directly (no round-trip through main window)

### Fixed
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — eliminated by proportional column/padding scaling and lower font floor
- **Zoom reset on tab refresh** — matrix tabs now re-apply zoom to all rebuilt brand containers unconditionally

---

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Undo/redo UI freeze** — undo and redo operations now run on the worker pool instead of the main thread, so the window stays fully responsive during the operation
- **Undo/redo real-time refresh** — after an undo/redo, the currently visible tab (inventory, matrix, transactions, analytics) now refreshes in place; you no longer need to switch tabs and come back to see the changes
- **Undo/redo button responsiveness** — undo/redo buttons re-enable immediately after the DB operation completes, before the view refresh; chained undos feel instant
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — header labels (`MIN-VORRAT`, `BESTELLUNG`, `DIFFERENZ`, `BESTAND`) now stay fully visible when zooming out; column widths measured against the new font and padded with a generous 48px buffer

### Changed
- **Thread-safe undo commands** — all undo/redo command lambdas are now DB-only (no UI calls from worker threads); main-thread refresh handled centrally in `_on_undo_done`
- **Inventory filter on undo** — debounce disabled for the post-undo refresh so the product table updates instantly

---

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Per-brand matrix sections** — "All Brands" view shows separate sections per brand, each with its own correct part-type columns; outer scroll with full-sized sections and sticky headers
- **No Colors option** — "No Colors" button in color picker removes all colour variants for a model, keeping only the base product
- **Expanded colour palette** — added Red, Pink, Yellow, Orange to available colours in settings and matrix picker

### Fixed
- **Brand display cleanup** — Samsung/Xiaomi no longer show Apple-only part types (stale inventory rows cleaned on startup)

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show color totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under "Show sell totals"). When off, the per-color sub-rows hide their SELL / COST / TOTAL cells (rendered as `—`, not editable), so valuation is only shown on the model summary row. Useful when all color variants share the same price — the per-color repeats are just noise. Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_color_totals` (reuses `app_config`, no migration). Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_color_totals`. Default ON — existing layouts unchanged until toggled.
- **Color picker on aggregate stock edits** — when a model has color variants, double-clicking STOCK on the model summary row now pops a "Choose Color" dialog (listing the variants of that model × part-type). Previously the edit silently landed on whichever sibling was returned first (usually White), because the parent row's meta held `any_item.id` — a real bug that let stock ops overwrite the wrong color. Uses `ItemRepository.get_colored_siblings`.

### Changed
- **Sell / cost price edits on aggregate rows propagate to all color variants.** Editing SELL or COST on the model summary row of a colored model now writes the new price to every sibling in one pass, with a single bundled undo entry (`Sell <model>·<part> all colors → X` / `Cost … all colors → X`). The prompt title gains a "(all colors)" suffix and a trailing note so it's obvious what's about to happen. Single-color (non-aggregate) edits keep the previous per-item behaviour. Rationale: in practice variants of the same model share pricing — editing one and not the rest was a common source of drift.

### Fixed
- **Aggregate stock edits no longer silently hit the wrong color.** See the color-picker note above.

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show sell totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under UI Scale). When off, the matrix TOTAL column and the value portion of the per-part-type cards + the grand-total card are hidden, so shop assistants see stock counts without seeing sell valuation. Units stay visible either way. Cost mode (PIN-gated via 👁) overrides the hide so the cost/sell comparison still makes sense when the owner has authenticated.
  - Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_sell_totals` (reuses the existing `app_config` key-value mechanism — no DB migration needed).
  - Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_sell_totals`.
  - Default is ON — existing users see zero change until they toggle it off.
  - Live-update on Save: the existing settings-close rebuild chain (`ShopConfig.invalidate()` → `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` fast path → `tab.refresh()`) propagates the new state to every matrix tab instantly.

### Fixed
- **Float-precision display bug** — `7 × 22.99` was rendering as `€160.9299999999998` in matrix TOTAL cells and cards. `ShopConfig.format_currency` used `str(amount)` which exposed the full Python-float representation. Now formats with `f"{float(amount):,.2f}"` — always exactly 2 decimals, thousands separator included. One-line fix at source means every money display across the whole app (matrix cells, cards, Quick Scan, Sales, POS, Analytics, Reports, Purchase Orders) benefits automatically.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Lazy UI construction — startup & settings-close no longer freeze

- **`NavController.register_lazy(key, page_index, factory, on_activate)`** — new API. The factory runs on first navigation; a lightweight `QWidget` placeholder holds the stack slot until then. `register_placeholder(page_index)` + `realize(key)` + `get_lazy_instance(key)` complete the contract.
- **`_MatrixPlaceholder`** — matrix category tabs are now placeholders until the user clicks their sidebar entry. On first click `NavController._go_matrix` swaps the placeholder for a real `MatrixTab` in the same stack slot, emits `navigated`, then kicks the first `refresh()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so the switch paints before the DB round-trip lands.
- **10 static pages migrated to lazy**: `SalesPage`, `CustomersPanel`, `PurchaseOrdersPage`, `ReturnsPage`, `BarcodeGenPage`, `ReportsPage`, `SuppliersPage`, `AnalyticsPage`, `AuditPage`, `PriceListsPage`. Each has a closure-style factory that sets `self._xxx_page` before returning; the `AnalyticsPage` factory also wires `navigate_to.connect(nav_ctrl.go)` after construction. Eager pages (`InventoryPage`, `TransactionsPage`, `QuickScanTab`) stay immediate.
- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract for pages/tabs: `self.async_refresh(fetch, apply, key_suffix, debounce_ms)`. Keyed cancellation, `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted`, error-path falls through to a non-blocking `_show_empty_state` instead of a modal. Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab inherits it.
- **UI-thread watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) — opt-in via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`. A 10 ms `QTimer` stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread warns whenever the main thread hasn't heartbeat in > 50 ms. Zero cost when disabled. Regressions that put sync DB calls back on the UI thread show up instantly in the logs.
- **Grand-total card** at the end of the matrix cards strip — emerald-accent anchor showing total units and total valuation across every part-type in the current filter. Metric tag flips `sell` ↔ `cost` with the admin toggle, exactly like the per-part-type cards.

### Performance

- **Worker pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result / error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can coordinate with in-flight critical workers.
  - `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` — called from `MainWindow.closeEvent`; cancels all work, stops debounce timers, `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. No more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` are logged instead of silently killing the signal chain.

- **Settings-close freeze — fully resolved.** `ensure_matrix_entries` (can touch 1000+ rows) now runs on `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The admin dialog returns **instantly**. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs` → fast-path, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`). `on_error` fallback still rebuilds so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.

- **`rebuild_matrix_tabs` fast path** — if the active-category set hasn't changed (the common case on settings close), existing realised tabs are KEPT intact and just marked `_dirty=True`; the currently-visible tab gets a refresh via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`. Previously rebuild unconditionally nuked every realised tab into a placeholder, leaving the user looking at an empty page for a moment. Only true category adds/removes/reorders take the slow path and recreate placeholders.

- **`MatrixTab.refresh()`** fully async — every DB query (`get_matrix_items`, `get_all`, `get_brands`) runs off the UI thread via `POOL.submit`. In all-brands mode this replaced up to 12 synchronous repo hits per refresh with one pooled fetch; the UI thread no longer touches the DB during brand-combo changes, cost-toggle flips, or post-edit refreshes. `_add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` accept pre-fetched `models=` / `item_map=` kwargs so the worker feeds every brand section at once.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** — per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between tabs. Each tab has a `_dirty` flag; on `COST_VIS.changed`, only the currently visible tab refreshes immediately, others flip `_dirty=True` and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries every time the 👁 button is clicked.

- **`ProductTable.load()`** — replaced per-row `setRowHeight(i, 48)` loop with a single pre-loop `verticalHeader().setDefaultSectionSize(48)`. The per-row call triggered a layout recalc even with `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` — saves 400-600 ms of startup UI-thread work for a 300-item inventory.

- **Per-page async conversions** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `_refresh` split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` combined `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` into one `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, 150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` combined `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **`AnalyticsPage.__init__`** — inline `self.refresh()` deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, self.refresh)` so widget-tree construction completes before the skeleton paint + 5 POOL workers fire. Combined with lazy construction, analytics costs nothing until the user actually opens the page.

- **`StartupController._on_ok`** — removed the eager `analytics_page.refresh()` call now that analytics is lazy. Saved 200-400 ms of skeleton-paint + worker dispatch at startup for a page the user may never open.

### Fixed

- **Blank matrix tab after settings close** — root cause was a `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` guard inside `MatrixTab.refresh()`. Qt dispatches slots in connection order, so user callbacks fire **before** the pool's own `_cleanup` slot; the guard incorrectly returned `True` inside the very callback that was triggered by result delivery. Guard removed (WAL handles concurrent reads safely); the fast-path `refresh()` in `rebuild_matrix_tabs` is now deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so it runs on a clean event-loop idle tick.
- **Silent matrix refresh failures** — `MatrixTab.refresh()`'s `POOL.submit` now has an `on_error` handler that logs the failure with the category key. No more invisible worker exceptions leaving a page blank.
- **`ProductTable.setRowHeight` in loop** — per-row call triggered layout recalcs that `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` couldn't suppress. Moved to `defaultSectionSize` once before the loop.

### Changed

- Matrix staggering experiment reverted — staggering brand sections across ticks via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` opened race windows where a second refresh mid-chain left the page blank. Correctness > 200 ms of visual smoothness: `_apply_refresh` builds all sections inline.
- `MainWindow.closeEvent` now calls `POOL.shutdown(2000)` for graceful worker drain.

---

## [2.3.10] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Cost valuation — PIN-gated matrix redesign
- **`cost_price` column** on `inventory_items` — purchase / buy price, persisted per item. Schema V16 migration adds the column automatically on first launch.
- **Matrix columns bumped 5 → 7** per part-type group: `MIN-STOCK · DIFFERENCE · STOCK · ORDER · SELL · COST · TOTAL`.
  - **SELL** = the previous "PRICE" column renamed for clarity (item.sell_price with part-type default fallback; edit flow unchanged).
  - **COST** = new, shows `item.cost_price` in the shop's accent blue. **Hidden by default** — only shown after the owner toggles it.
  - **TOTAL** = always visible. Metric flips with the cost toggle:
    - Default: `stock × effective_sell_price`
    - Admin mode: `stock × cost_price`
  - Cell tooltip clarifies which metric is active ("Stock × sell = …" / "Stock × cost = …").
- **👁 cost-visibility toggle** in every matrix tab toolbar. Click prompts for `ShopConfig.admin_pin` (if configured, via `QInputDialog` password-echo — same pattern as `open_admin`). Button swaps closed-eye ↔ talking-eye icon and shows a green accent border when active. One flip fans out to every matrix tab via `CostVisibility.changed`.
- **Professional per-part-type cards** at the top of every matrix tab (name · total units · total valuation · `sell`/`cost` suffix). Live metric — switches from sell-based → cost-based totals when the toggle is on. Card strip lives inside a restored collapsible `BRAND & LEGEND` section alongside the brand filter row.
- **Editable cost_price** — double-click a COST cell (admin mode only) opens the same numeric dialog pattern used for sell; full Undo/Redo via `ItemRepository.update_cost_price()`.
- **Currency symbol everywhere** — SELL, COST, TOTAL cells + tooltips format through a new `_fmt_money()` helper backed by `ShopConfig.format_currency()`.

### New services / repos
- `app/services/cost_visibility.py` — session-local `COST_VIS` singleton (`QObject` with `changed` signal). Default `visible=False` on every app start — nothing persists, so sensitive valuation never leaks on an unattended laptop.
- `ItemRepository.update_cost_price(item_id, new_cost)` — new write method; `_build()` reads `cost_price` when the column exists.
- `_type_visible_width(table, ti)` helper in `matrix_widget.py` — sum of *visible* column widths for a part-type group, so banner chips never over-stretch when the COST column is hidden.
- `_SUB_MIN / _SUB_BB / _SUB_STOCK / _SUB_ORDER / _SUB_SELL / _SUB_PRICE / _SUB_TOTAL` sub-column constants — arithmetic across the matrix now self-documents.

### Performance — professional worker-pool overhaul

- **Pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result and error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch, so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - New `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can skip a refresh while a critical worker (e.g. `admin:matrix_ensure`) is still writing.
  - New `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` that cancels everything, stops debounce timers, and `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. Called from `MainWindow.closeEvent` — no more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback-error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` handlers are now logged instead of swallowing the signal stream.

- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract every page/tab now follows:
  - `self.async_refresh(fetch=…, apply=…, key_suffix=…, debounce_ms=…)`
  - Auto-cancels prior task via `POOL` keyed as `f"{POOL_KEY_PREFIX}:{key_suffix}"`.
  - `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted` so callbacks skip deleted widgets (tab closed mid-load, language rebuild, etc.).
  - Error path falls through to `_show_empty_state(msg)` inline, not a modal — no more freezing on an error dialog.
  - Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab and future tab gets it for free.

- **Startup freeze — resolved** —
  - `MainWindow._build_ui` defers `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`; the main window paints and becomes interactive before any DB work.
  - On first-run setup, `ensure_matrix_entries()` (can touch 1000+ rows) runs on a `POOL` worker; the widget rebuild runs in the `on_result` callback on the main thread.

- **Settings-close freeze — resolved** —
  - Admin-dialog close now submits `ensure_matrix_entries` to `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The dialog returns instantly. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs`, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`).
  - `on_error` fallback still rebuilds tabs so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.
  - `MatrixTab.refresh()` early-returns when `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` — prevents mid-write reads and sets `_dirty=True` so the tab reconciles on its next `showEvent`.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** —
  - Every `MatrixTab` now has a `_dirty` flag. On `COST_VIS.changed`, only the **currently visible** tab refreshes immediately; others flip the flag and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries when the 👁 button is clicked.
  - Each `MatrixTab` uses a per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between parallel tabs.

- **Per-page migrations off the UI thread** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `SalesPage._refresh` — both split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` — `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` combined into a single `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, delay_ms=150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` — `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` combined into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **UI watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) —
  - Opt-in dev diagnostic enabled via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`.
  - A 10 ms `QTimer` on the UI thread stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread polls every 50 ms and logs a warning whenever the stamp is older than a configurable threshold (default 50 ms). Instantly surfaces any regression that puts a sync DB call back on the UI thread.

### Fixed
- Banner chip widths now align correctly with the visible columns when the COST column is hidden (previously over-stretched by one column-width).
- `UnboundLocalError: QScrollArea` on `MatrixTab.__init__` — a nested `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import … QScrollArea` shadowed the module-level import; removed the duplicate.
- Duplicate `BRAND:` label (collapsible section header + filter row) — section header restored to `BRAND & LEGEND` and now wraps both cards + filter together.
- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

### Changed
- Matrix edit dialogs for price split into **Sell Price** and **Cost Price** with distinct titles / Undo labels.
- Cost edit instant-repaints the clicked COST cell + neighbouring TOTAL cell synchronously before the DB refresh lands, so the whole edit lands in a single visual frame. SELL edit does the same for TOTAL when not in cost mode.
- Schema version bumped **15 → 16**.

---

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-20

### Added
#### Pricing · Quick Scan · Invoices
- **Part-type default price** — Admin → Part Types now has a "Default price" field. Every item inheriting the part type takes that price; per-item `sell_price` still overrides. New "PRICE" column in the part-type admin table.
- **€ / Price column in the matrix** — new column per part type. Green when a per-item override exists, grey when falling back to the part-type default. Double-click to edit; Ctrl+Z undoes.
- **Quick Scan live pricing & totals** — pending table now shows **Unit Price** and **Line Total** per scanned line + a totals card with **ITEMS · SUBTOTAL · GRAND TOTAL** (accent green, JetBrains Mono). Currency formatted via `ShopConfig.format_currency`.
- **Customer field on Quick Scan** — optional input; printed on the invoice when present, otherwise a walk-in record.
- **PDF invoices on every commit** — confirming a scan asks **A4 invoice** or **Thermal receipt**, persists the header + line items, and writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\invoices\INV-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.pdf`. Feed row shows an **Open** button. TAKEOUT → "INVOICE"; INSERT → "STOCK RECEIPT". Layout preference remembered via QSettings.
- **New `ScanInvoiceService`** (A4 + 80 mm thermal fpdf2 layouts) and **`InvoiceRepository`** (day-prefixed numbering + price snapshot per line).

#### Reports — full overhaul
- **5 new reports**: Stock Valuation (per part type, category subtotals, grand total), Sales (with top-10 best sellers), Scan Invoices (IN/OUT history with filter), Expiring Stock (urgency-coloured), Category Performance (stock + movement per category).
- **Inventory report** now groups by **Category → Part Type** with per-section subtotals, a Brand column, and a grand-total emerald bar at the end.
- **Date range picker** on the reports page — presets (Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · This year · Custom) + `QDateEdit` from/to pickers. Applied to every date-aware report.
- **Operation filter** — contextual for Transactions (IN/OUT/ADJUST/CREATE) and Scan Invoices (ALL/IN/OUT).
- **Output path + three actions** — status bar shows the saved PDF path with **Open PDF**, **Open folder** (selects file in Explorer), **Copy path**.
- **`_ReportPDF.header() / footer()` overrides** — shop banner, title subtitle, and `Page X of Y` footer render on **every page** (not just page 1) via `alias_nb_pages()`.
- **Logo support** — `ShopConfig.logo_path` is rendered top-left of every report header when the file exists.
- **Per-table pagination** — every table redraws its column headers on a new page when rows cross the bottom margin.

#### Analytics — professional dashboard
- **Top date-range bar** — Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · Year · Custom, with automatic previous-period comparison.
- **Executive KPI row** — 4 tiles (Stock Value · Revenue · Transactions · Low Stock) each with a trend sparkline, ▲/▼ delta badge vs the previous equal-length period, and click-to-drill-down.
- **Brand-separated Valuation section** — Brand chips row at the top, then one card per brand containing category-grouped part-type rows with **share-of-brand** progress bars, category subtotals, and a brand subtotal strip. Bottom: gradient emerald Grand Total.
- **Valuation filter bar** — Brand combo + Category combo + "Clear filters" button. Active-filter badge shows how many filters are applied; grand total note shows the active filter context.
- **Sales section** — revenue trend dual-line chart with previous-period ghost overlay, mini-KPIs (sales count · units sold · avg basket · best day), top sellers + top customers HBars with currency formatting.
- **Stock movement section** — IN vs OUT dual-line chart, busiest-hours HBar, colour-coded recent activity feed.
- **Scan invoices section** — 4 KPIs (count · IN total · OUT total · avg), daily IN/OUT dual-line, top-invoice-customers HBar.
- **New UI components** — `KpiTile` (label + sparkline + delta + click), `DeltaBadge` (▲/▼ pill), `SkeletonBlock` (animated shimmer), `EmptyState` upgraded (icon + retry button), `PivotTable` redesigned as brand-separated valuation, `DualLineChart` (current + ghost overlay + hover tooltip).
- **`AnalyticsService` facade** — one class computes every tile's data block, safe to run on worker threads; tiles load independently via `POOL.submit` and swap skeletons for content as each block completes.
- **Drill-down navigation** — click KPI tile, pivot row, or brand chip → navigates to the filtered Inventory / Sales / Transactions page.

### Schema
- **V15 migration** — adds `part_types.default_price` (REAL, nullable) + two new tables `scan_invoices` and `scan_invoice_items` for invoice records, with indexes on date and invoice_id.

### New architecture
- **Repository helpers**: `ItemRepository.get_value_by_brand / get_value_by_part_type / get_value_pivot`; `TransactionRepository.get_daily_aggregates / get_hourly_aggregates`; `SaleRepository.revenue_daily / top_customers`; `InvoiceRepository.get_totals / get_daily / get_top_customers`.
- **`ScanSessionService.commit(layout, customer_name)`** — snapshots each line's price to `scan_invoice_items` so historical invoices stay stable even if prices change later.
- **`PendingScanItem`** — gains `unit_price` (captured at scan time) and a `line_total` property.
- **`HBarChart.set_data(..., value_format=callable)`** — optional formatter so chart values render with the shop currency (`€12,340.00`) instead of bare integers.

### Fixed
- **Discrepancy report crash** — added missing `_GRAY_700` / `_GRAY_100` colour constants and implemented the missing `_safe()` sanitiser. PDFs render without `NameError` / `AttributeError`.
- **Column overflow on inventory + transaction reports** — widths re-balanced so columns sum to exactly 186 mm (usable page width).
- **Missing page numbers / orphaned continuation pages** — fixed by header/footer overrides.
- **Reports now save to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\reports\`** — same tree used by invoices and backups (was `%TEMP%`).
- **Valuation pivot ambiguous column bug** — renamed the SQL alias to `brand_name` to avoid clashing with `phone_models.brand` / `inventory_items.brand`, then GROUP BY on the full expression.
- **Brand attribution in reports** — every report resolver now falls back through `model_brand → brand → "(no brand)"`; matrix items no longer show as "(no brand)".
- **Analytics valuation scope** — includes zero-stock brand/part-type combos so the full inventory scope is visible (no more "only Apple and Samsung"); grand total unaffected since zeros add nothing.

### Changed
- **Transaction report** accepts a date range + operation filter (was hardcoded to 30 days with no op filter).
- **Backward-compatible analytics refresh API** — `_fetch_all_data` + `_apply_all_data` still exist so `main_window`'s existing `POOL.submit("analytics_refresh", …)` continues to work; the new implementation forwards to `refresh()` on the main thread.

---

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Content-aware column widths** — every table column now sizes to `max(proportional_target, header_text_fit, widest_cell_fit)` at the active font, so headers and model names are ALWAYS fully visible at any zoom level. Applied to matrix, inventory, transactions, and admin tables.
- **Per-item font scaling** — matrix items with individual `setFont` (`_FONT_MODEL` 11pt, `_FONT_COLOR` 9pt, `_FONT_BRAND` 12pt, `_FONT_DATA` 10pt, `_FONT_MONO` 11pt) now scale correctly via a new `BASE_PT_ROLE` marker that remembers each item's 100% point size
- **Real-time live zoom on slider drag** — every slider tick applies zoom through the 16 ms coalescer; drag feels instant with no lag

### Changed
- **Only the active tab is re-zoomed** on slider changes — previously all 6 matrix tabs were iterated every tick (~15 000 items rebuilt per drag step). Inactive tabs catch up lazily when the user navigates to them via `matrix_tab.refresh()`.
- **QFont cache keyed by (family, weight, base_pt)** — a typical matrix has ~1000 items but only ~5 unique font variants; reusing the cached `QFont` instances drastically reduces allocations during zoom
- **Widget-level QSS on QHeaderView** — overrides app-wide `font-size: 11px` and `padding: 10px 16px` so programmatic `setFont` actually takes effect; header height scales with the font + proportional vertical padding
- **Footer zoom widget fully locked** — every child (slider, buttons, preset, divider) uses `Fixed/Fixed` size policy with `setFixedSize`; preset button is `setFixedSize(56, 22)` so percentage text changes ("50%" ↔ "200%") never shift the layout

### Fixed
- **Table headers disappearing at low zoom** — caused by app-wide QSS overriding per-table `setFont`; now overridden with widget-level stylesheet so headers render at the actual scaled font
- **Model names clipped** — column now measures widest model cell using that cell's own scaled font, not the widget default
- **Footer zoom group stretching during drag** — every inner widget locked to `Fixed` size policy and the group itself pinned to a fixed total width
- **Zoom slider lag** — live-drag now handled via a 16 ms coalescing timer in `ZoomService` plus visible-tab-only dispatch; slider release commits synchronously

---

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Professional table zoom** — `ZoomService` singleton drives footer-slider zoom for data tables only: matrix tabs (Displays, Batteries, Cases, …), inventory product table, transaction table, and every QTableWidget inside admin panels. Clean separation from app-chrome sizing.
- **Redesigned footer zoom widget** — zoom-out button + slider with tick marks at every preset + zoom-in button + preset dropdown (50/75/100/125/150/200 + Fit + Reset) + reset button; grouped in a bordered pill with proper QToolButton hover/pressed states
- **Zoom persistence** — table zoom saved to `ShopConfig.zoom_level`, restored on launch; 500ms debounced save so slider drags don't hit the DB
- **UI Scale admin setting** — new dropdown in Shop Settings → Regional & Display: Small (85%), Normal (100%), Large (115%), Extra Large (130%). Controls overall app chrome size (sidebar, header, footer, base font). Restart required — shows a dialog confirmation on change.
- **Slimmer sidebar default** — base width reduced from 240 px → 192 px for a more professional look; UI Scale enlarges it if the user prefers

### Changed
- **Zoom scope limited to tables** — sidebar, header, footer, dashboard KPI cards, analytics charts no longer respond to the footer zoom slider (by design — use UI Scale for chrome sizing)
- **Truly proportional table scaling** — removed arbitrary font floors (9pt body / 8pt header); minimum 6pt for genuine shrinking at 50% zoom. Column widths, row heights, padding all scale via `ZOOM.scale(base, minimum)` — no hard floors fighting the zoom
- **Zoom shortcuts centralised** — Ctrl+=, Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, Ctrl+Scroll all route through `ZoomService` so footer + shortcuts + wheel stay in sync
- **Matrix refresh preserves zoom** — after refresh, containers re-apply current zoom factor directly (no round-trip through main window)

### Fixed
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — eliminated by proportional column/padding scaling and lower font floor
- **Zoom reset on tab refresh** — matrix tabs now re-apply zoom to all rebuilt brand containers unconditionally

---

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Undo/redo UI freeze** — undo and redo operations now run on the worker pool instead of the main thread, so the window stays fully responsive during the operation
- **Undo/redo real-time refresh** — after an undo/redo, the currently visible tab (inventory, matrix, transactions, analytics) now refreshes in place; you no longer need to switch tabs and come back to see the changes
- **Undo/redo button responsiveness** — undo/redo buttons re-enable immediately after the DB operation completes, before the view refresh; chained undos feel instant
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — header labels (`MIN-VORRAT`, `BESTELLUNG`, `DIFFERENZ`, `BESTAND`) now stay fully visible when zooming out; column widths measured against the new font and padded with a generous 48px buffer

### Changed
- **Thread-safe undo commands** — all undo/redo command lambdas are now DB-only (no UI calls from worker threads); main-thread refresh handled centrally in `_on_undo_done`
- **Inventory filter on undo** — debounce disabled for the post-undo refresh so the product table updates instantly

---

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Per-brand matrix sections** — "All Brands" view shows separate sections per brand, each with its own correct part-type columns; outer scroll with full-sized sections and sticky headers
- **No Colors option** — "No Colors" button in color picker removes all colour variants for a model, keeping only the base product
- **Expanded colour palette** — added Red, Pink, Yellow, Orange to available colours in settings and matrix picker

### Fixed
- **Brand display cleanup** — Samsung/Xiaomi no longer show Apple-only part types (stale inventory rows cleaned on startup)

---

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Sticky model column** — frozen left-side table for model names stays visible when scrolling horizontally in the matrix
- **Part-type banner bar** — colour-coded part-type names displayed above column headers via synced QScrollArea
- **Excel-like zoom** — Ctrl+Scroll / Ctrl+Plus/Minus zoom (50–200%) with compact footer slider, auto-reset on page switch, hidden on non-table pages
- **Per-model product colours** — right-click any model row in the matrix to select which colours (Black, Silver, Gold…) per model; same toggle UI in settings Admin → Part Types → Model Colors section (double-click to edit)
- **Series separators** — thin visible divider lines between model series groups (X-series, 11-series, A0x, A1x, S2x) for easier reading
- **Collapsible matrix toolbar** — inventory-style clickable section header to hide/show brand filter and legend chips
- **Auto-fit model column** — frozen model column width auto-sizes to the longest model name
- **Live clock** — footer timestamp updates every second automatically
- **Professional splash screen** — geometric inventory cube icon drawn with QPainter, dynamic version badge from `APP_VERSION`, rounded card with emerald glow
- **Custom app icon** — isometric cube icon as `.ico` (multi-resolution 16–256px) and `.png`, used for window, taskbar, installer, and README
- **Full actions toolbar** — New Product, Export CSV, Import CSV, Report, Bulk Edit, Refresh buttons in inventory dashboard
- **Model reorder** — move up/down buttons in Admin → Models panel (same style as part types)
- **Per-model colours in settings** — Admin → Part Types → Model Colors card shows all models with their colour overrides; double-click to edit
- **Import CSV** — toolbar button opens file picker and imports inventory data directly

### Fixed
- **Theme toggle persistence** — toggling theme now saves to database; closing admin no longer reverts to old theme
- **Theme toggle UI** — sidebar, header, footer, matrix legend chips, inventory section headers all update correctly
- **Zoom separators** — separator rows stay at fixed 3px height during zoom
- **Worker pool crash** — wrapped signal emit in try/except to handle widget deletion during background tasks
- **QFont warning** — suppressed harmless `QFont::setPointSize` Qt warning via `qInstallMessageHandler`
- **UAC rejection** — `launch_installer()` returns `bool`; app only quits if UAC was accepted
- **Download cancel** — cancel button on update download progress dialog
- **Installer cache** — downloaded installer stored in persistent `%LOCALAPPDATA%` cache instead of temp dir
- **Cached installer reuse** — if installer already downloaded and SHA256 matches, skip re-download
- **CSV export** — now opens file save dialog instead of crashing on missing `file_path` argument
- **Quick action undo** — +1/-1 buttons now show undo toast (same as full stock dialog)
- **Quick action detail sync** — +1/-1 updates the detail bar instantly (stock count, status badge)
- **Model reorder** — fixed `reorder()` to preserve brand-specific sort_order base; `get_all()` now sorts by `sort_order` instead of re-sorting naturally
- **Per-model colour removal** — unselected colours now properly deleted from ALL part types, not just one

### Changed
- **Schema V14** — 5 new performance indexes on `inventory_items` (active, stock, part_type_id, model+pt, model+pt+color)
- **Connection pooling** — thread-local cached connections instead of new `sqlite3.connect()` per query
- **SQLite optimised** — `synchronous=NORMAL`, `cache_size=20MB`, `temp_store=MEMORY` pragmas
- **Batch inserts** — `_ensure_all_entries()` uses `executemany()` instead of per-row INSERT (10-50x faster)
- **Deferred health checks** — `run_startup_checks()` moved to background thread after 2s delay
- **Lazy theme loading** — only generates QSS for active theme at startup, not all 4
- **Matrix rendering** — pre-indexed item_map for O(1) model lookup; `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` during bulk cell creation
- **Slim dropdown style** — all QComboBox across the app use minimal bottom-line style (transparent, no box border)
- **Compact filter bar** — 26px controls, no container frame, category inline, icon-only reset button
- **Compact actions bar** — 36px toolbar with 6 action buttons, keyboard hints, themed styles
- **Version unified** — `main.py` and splash screen import `APP_VERSION` from `version.py`
- **Pre-release version parsing** — strips `-rc1`, `-beta` suffixes before comparing
- **Manifest validation** — validates URL format, SHA256 hex, version parseability
- **min_version enforcement** — `check_for_update()` respects `min_version` field
- **CI/CD pipeline** — release branch → PR → auto-merge to main with retry
- **CI version stamping** — auto-stamps `version.py`, `file_version_info.txt`, `.iss`, `README.md` badge

### Changed
- Product name column is now left-aligned and always fills available table width
